  
CMP6230 Coursework Task Sheet 1 Data Analytics Pipeline: Planning and Design

Your first task will be to **plan** and **design** a **data management** and **data analytics** strategy based on using data within a specific problem domain, to produce analytics insights and machine learning models. This will be documented within your log report.

The purpose of this task is to contribute towards meeting the module learning outcome: “Model and effectively communicate **data management** requirements for **analytical operations**”

Underlined are the four key parts of the learning outcome, but what do they mean?

* Model[1](#1-remember,-we-can-think-of-models-as-abstract-representations-of-a-given-object-or-phenomena-of-interest-with-a-focus-on-emphasising-relevant-information-and-removing-irrelevant-information.-they-are-used-for-the-purpose-of-reviewing-and-analysing-that-model-to-better-understand-the-object-or-phenomena-it-represents-and-can-also-be-used-for-predicting-certain-behaviours-or-events-of-that-object-or-phenomena-based-on-the-properties,-structure-and-constraints-that-the-model-captures.)

  * You will be expected to provide detailed **evidence** of the relevant **structures** and

    **processes** used to meet the aim (producing a pipeline capable of analytical operations)

* Effectively communicate

  * This evidence produced from the modelling process should be clearly explained and

    well justified throughout, to allow the reader to better understand your thought process when attempting the planning and design task.

* Data Management requirements

  * The modelling process needs to consider not only how the data will be stored, but how it will be used, this should also be communicated appropriately.

* Analytical Operations

  * The modelling process must also consider that the stored data will be used to develop Machine Learning models and apply various analytics techniques. These considerations must also be communicated to the reader.

1 Remember, we can think of models as abstract representations of a given object or phenomena of interest with a focus on emphasising relevant information and removing irrelevant information. They are used for the purpose of reviewing and analysing that model to better understand the object or phenomena it represents and can also be used for predicting certain behaviours or events of that object or phenomena based on the properties, structure and constraints that the model captures.

# **Getting started**

## **Exercise 1: Step 1**

Identify 3 candidate source data sets[2](#2-we-recommend-at-least-one-of-them-be-the-same-dataset-you-and-your-research-team-are-leveraging-in-cmp6202) that could be leveraged to develop a Machine Learning model to solve a supervised learning task (e.g. a supervised learning model to determine whether a given flight is likely to be delayed based on past data).

For each candidate source data set you should attempt to **discuss** and **justify** the following:

* What is it?

  * e.g., what data does it represent?

* Who / what was it collected from?

  * Where was the data originally sampled from?

    * e.g. Is it collected from particular patients at a particular set of hospitals?

* Why was it collected?

  * e.g., why does this data exist in the first place?

* Where did you get it from? o Where did you find it?

* What is its logical structure? o e.g., Is this source data a “flat file”?, “a collection of tables from a relational database?”, etc.

  * What does it “look” like structurally? Document this

    * Show the **logical** structure of the input data using an appropriate diagram such as an ERD

* How is it currently stored?

  * e.g., Is it from a local database? A file? A web service?

  * e.g., What kind of database? How is the data currently physically stored using that database engine?

  * e.g., What kind of file? How is data physically stored within that file on the file system?

* How could it be used to develop a machine learning model?

  * What parts of the dataset could be leveraged to develop the model?

    * e.g in a supervised learning task: what is the target variable and what are the predictor variables?

    * What is the **“Ground truth”**?

  * Has this dataset previously been used to develop Machine Learning models?

    * If not, why?

2 We recommend at least one of them be the same dataset you and your research team are leveraging in CMP6202

Choose one of the candidate datasets that you believe would be suitable for developing Machine

Learning, this will be used for the later planning of a data analytics pipeline intended to ingest and utilise the data within this dataset. Discuss the reasoning behind your choice of data set, making sure you

precisely identify how you believe the source data set could be leveraged for Machine Learning.

|  Warning\! |
| ----- |
| For the particularly ambitious, you may wish to investigate how two or more dataset sources could be **combined from their different data sources into a single dataset**[3](#3-we-sometimes-call-this-“data-blending”-when-it-is-done-for-a-specific-use-case,-this-can-also-be-compared-with-the-etl-process) to augment your dataset with additional data from another source. A note of caution: you must be very careful when attempting to establish relationships between data from disparate sources as they may not necessarily be suitable to combine. |

3 We sometimes call this “[Data Blending”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_blending) when it is done for a specific use case, this can also be compared with the [ETL](https://blog.panoply.io/data-blending-what-it-is-and-how-to-do-it) process

# **What you need to do**

## **Exercise 1: Step 2**

**Plan** out, **justify** and **iteratively refine** the **design** of an appropriate data analytics pipeline for the storage and processing of a given data set, the data analytics pipeline should meet the needs of two major

consumers of the data:

* Reporting and Ad hoc querying by Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Business Analysts

  * These consumers of the data should be able to run ad-hoc queries and generate reports on  
    the ingested data stored in your analytics data store / data base by accessing the database in an analytics environment such as an IPython notebook.

* The Automated Machine Learning pipeline

  * This consumer of the data will retrieve the data from the analytics store for the purpose of building supervised machine learning models in an automated fashion

This section of the log report should include a detailed discussion of the following stages of the data analytics pipeline:

* Data Ingestion

* Data Pre-processing

* Model Development

* Model Deployment

* Model Monitoring

For each stage, you should aim to discuss

* The **What**

  * What is the stage being undertaken?

    * e.g. what does “data ingestion” actually mean?

  * What are the key components, systems and concepts that will make up this stage?

    * e.g what tools and techniques are involved in the data ingestion process?

  * What are the input dependencies to this stage?

    * e.g. the data ingestion stage will likely require data

* How will this data be passed into this stage of the pipeline?

* Are there any requirements as to how that data needs to be represented/structured as input? If so, why?

  * What are the expected outputs of this stage?

    * e.g. once the data ingestion stage is completed, what will the later stages actually “get” out of this stage?

* The **Why**

  * Why is this stage important?

    * e.g why is the data pre-processing stage needed?

  * Why are the key components, systems and concepts that make up this stage important?

    * e.g what does each tool or technique contribute to the task being undertaken?

* The **Who**

  * Who is involved with completing this stage?

    * Within an organisation, which people/roles would need to be involved in taking the input dependencies and processing them into an appropriate form to create the  
      outputs to this stage?

  * Who benefits from the outputs of this stage?

    * Within an organisation, the outputs of each stage of the pipeline must provide benefit to someone, which people/roles would likely benefit from this stage?

* The **How**

  * How will the stage be completed?

    * Each stage can be thought of as transforming its input dependencies into outputs to pass on to the later stages of the pipeline

    * But each stage itself has its own “internal pipeline” where we need to compose one or more internal processes to transform our inputs into our outputs

    * What are these individual processes that form the “internal pipeline” we need to compose?

    * What tools and techniques could be used to execute each process?

## **Exercise 1: Step 3**

The documentation of your pipeline should be accompanied by an appropriate plan for the storage of data within your analytics system, this plan should:

* Discuss the **chosen** input data set, its storage format and logical structure

  * Where is it from  
    * e.g., Is it from a local database? A file? A web service?

  * How is it stored?  
    * e.g., What kind of database? How is data physically stored using that database engine?  
    * e.g., What kind of file? How is data physically stored within that file on the file system?  
  * What is its logical structure?  
    * e.g., Is this source data a “flat file”? a collection of tables from a relational database?  
    * What does it “look” like structurally? Document this

      * Show the logical structure of the input data using an appropriate diagram such as an ERD

      * Detail and justify an appropriate logical and physical structure for the storage of data when it has been ingested

        * Physical structure  
        * Logical structure

          * How will it be represented and structured logically to the Data Engineers and Data Scientists who work with it?

          * What benefits and drawbacks will this structure provide?

          * What alternative structures could be used for the data?

            * One Big Table?

            * Dimensional Model?

              - Star Schema  
              - Snowflake Schema  
              - etc.

            * Normalised Relational Model?

          * What are the benefits and drawbacks of these alternative structures?

* Detail the process of how data will be extracted, loaded (and possibly transformed) from the original data source before being stored for later use by the analytics system

You should provide a detailed, well-justified discussion of each of these components

| Tip |
| ----- |
| The design and development process of real-world systems are often iterative, this means that you are likely to benefit from refining your process throughout the development lifecycle. Therefore, this task should not be seen as a static “tick-box” document, instead, it should be reviewed throughout your progress with the module assessment and iteratively refined as you gain a better understanding of how to appropriately tackle the problem. Importantly, later more refined versions of your plan can then be compared against earlier versions |
